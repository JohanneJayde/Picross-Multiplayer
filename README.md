- Must use Vue/Vuetify/Typescript front end
- Must use ASP.NET back end
- Must use a SQL database with Entity Framework

## How to obtain the full 50 points for the assignment

- Meet all of the above requirments
- The application should do something midly interisting, (e.g. it should probably do something more than just displaying a weather report)

## How to obtain the 50 points of extra credit

- These points are given out at the instructors discretion
- It will be very difficult to obtain all 50 points, but if you go beyond the basic criteria it should not be difficult to obtain partial points
- Some ways you may be able to obtain extra credit (doing multiple of these options will get you closer to 50 points)
  - Implement auth (e.g. some kind of login system) Alexa
  - Do something with SignalR (e.g. two way chat app)
  - Write an interisting or complex algorithm (e.g. suggesting similar products or reccommendations on an E-Commerce site)
  - Include complex animations (e.g. a video game in the browser, player driven character animations)
  - Use CI/CD pipelins and deploy your app to Azure
